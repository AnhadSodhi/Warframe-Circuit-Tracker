## How it works
* For the week and the corresponding warframes, it queries the Warframe wiki page for the Circuit (https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/The_Circuit)
* For the pictures of the Warframes, it uses the first image from a google search of the Warframe

## Usage instructions
* For Windows 10/11, download and run the provided .exe file
* For other platforms, you will have to build it yourself with the Python file
